''' Add more command characters. Especially handy for mobile phone users 
if '/' is hard to reach.

Usage: Load cmdchars.py and set plugins.var.python.cmdchars.characters.

If you want to use '-', ',' and 'ยง' as supplemental command characters:

    /set plugins.var.python.cmdchars.characters ,-ยง

In case you want to say something starting with ',', '-' or 'ยง' you have 
to type the character twice. Like: ",,Hello world!". This will result 
string ",Hello world!" to be output.
